    <p id="second">If you&apos;ve never heard the concept before it&apos;s because we just made it up. They don&apos;t exist. Literally.<br><br>We create fictional economy scenarios that turn something broken like a stock market into sustainable gambling experiments.<br></p>

  <div id ="overflow" class="p fixedo">The overflow of noise in our real world markets<br> catalyzes complex human behavior that injects disorder<br> and chaos to stock prices. The outcome? A random walk.<br>We all have seen it and we all know deep to our hearts<br> that in times of constant pressure prices are nothing<br> but a vapor wave.
    <br><br>

If it&apos;s a gamble the least we can do is to make it fair.

<h1>Abstract markets are blind markets.</h1>Which means: no real-time statistics, no price charts<br> and no chaos of bids and asks. There is two basic stages:<br> <b>COMMITMENT</b> and <b>REVEAL</b>. To explain it better let us introduce<br>our first market: Overpopulated.</div>

<div class="section">
  <div class="p fixede">At the very core of this economy and the concept of blind trust as a medium to guarantee efficiency is a very simple scheme of commit and reveal; a cryptographic primitive that if embedded to a smart contract mitigates the voluntary or involuntary manipulation of markets.<br><br>


If all participants commit their actions without knowledge of the current state of an asset, the asset itself could be more stable. We will find out. Quantum Hall is about experimental economics, and Overpopulated is our first run.<br><br>

In this enviroment you don't buy or sell stock, you migrate global citizens from country to country and there is no companies raising or falling in the charts, instead, a country is either stable or overpopulated.

    <div class="p fixedes">The massive migration market will be open daily from 8:00 am to 5:00 pm EST.<br><br> During this stage, migration is self-regulated and owners can allocate<br> their citizens on any countries they wish.


Each migration choice is submitted<br> to the network as a hashed secret and the new state of the globe will only be<br> known to the world after migration has concluded and all secrets revealed.

<br><br>

During open hours, the only information available to participants is the previous<br> global state and the counting number of qHalls migrating. The future state of each<br> an every country is unpredictable.
